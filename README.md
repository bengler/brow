# Brow

Brow automatically configures all you rack apps and pebbles to be served with unicorn through nginx. It
takes care of mapping all your pebbles into the url-space of all your apps.

## Necessary modules for nginx

You need nginx compiled with `--with-http_gzip_static_module` and `--with-http_stub_status_module`

With Homebrew on Mac OS X this can be achieved with:

```
brew install nginx-full --with-status --with-gzip-static
```

## Requirements

* You must have nginx installed via macports or homebrew
* All apps must use bundler and have unicorn in its Gemfile
* Currently you must use Mac OS X â€“ Ubuntu to follow

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:benglerpebbles/brow.git
    cd brow
    rake install

## Usage

Check that everytning installed correctly by listing configured services

    brow status

Now you have a .brow folder in your home directory which you can use to mount your rack services. Symlink all your
pebbles and apps somewhere inside ~/.brow and then do this to configure and launch everything:

    brow up

To launch everyting. This will launch a unicorn server for every app and pebble and configure the apps to
run with all pebbles proxied in via nginx. Each app will be available like this:

    http://yourapp.dev

To restart a single pebble or app, do this:

    brow restart checkpoint

To restart everything do

    brow restart

If this fails:

    brow restart --hard
    brow restart checkpoint --hard

To kill all services:

    brow down

To execute a command in all repos, do:

    brow exec bundle install

To tail all logs:

    brow log

## Pebbles?!

This is not the time nor place to describe the details of the pebbles spec, suffice it to say that each pebble is
proxied into the url space of every app at /api/[service-name]
